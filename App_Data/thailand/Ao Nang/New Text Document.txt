Ao Nang

Formally Ao Phra Nang (“Princess Bay”), Ao Nang is the most popular beach town in Krabi. It was originally a backpacker hotspot but now moving slowly upmarket as the airport brings in higher flyers. While not quite as scenic as Rai Leh, there is a good range of cheap accommodation, many good restaurants, easy transport and plenty of travel agencies, making it a good base for exploring Krabi.
