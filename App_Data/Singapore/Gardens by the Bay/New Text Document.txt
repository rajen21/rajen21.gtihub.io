Gardens by the Bay

Gardens by the Bay is a huge, colourful, futuristic park in the bay area of Singapore. The famous Supertree structures offer an impressive skywalk over the gardens, over-sized seashell-shaped greenhouses recreate chilly mountain climates and there are hundreds of trees and plants to discover, making this destination great fun for both kids and adults. The best place to grasp the size of Gardens by the Bay is from the top of Marina Bay Sands, which sits directly opposite the park, the space encompass 250 acres of reclaimed land on the waterfront. Getting here is easy, either via walkways from the hotel, giving you an elevated view of the gardens, or taking the slightly longer riverside promenade to enter the park near the two domes. Walking around the park wont cost you a cent but if you want to step inside the climate-controlled conservatories, or walk amongst the Supertrees, there is a fee. The main park area is open from 9:00 to 21:00.
