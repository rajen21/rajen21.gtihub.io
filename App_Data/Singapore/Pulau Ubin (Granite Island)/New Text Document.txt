Pulau Ubin (Granite Island)

For a look at what life in Singapore was like before it was all glamor and skyscrapers, visit Granite Island. The National Parks department calls a trip here a "throwback to Singapore in the 1960s," where people live in simple villages (the last in the country) and farming and fishing are still a way of life.
