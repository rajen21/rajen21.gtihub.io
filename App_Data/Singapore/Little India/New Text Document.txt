Little India 


Little India is the centre of life for Singapores Indian community, and a visit to this buzzing neighbourhood is sure to awaken all your senses be it through the multi-coloured shop-houses that line the streets, the spiritual chants from the various mosques and temples, or the pungent aromas that infuse the night air when the demand for food reaches its peak. The colour, smiles and smells are all authentically sub continental and warm, making this one of Singapores must-visit districts. If you want to experience Little India for yourself, head to Serangoon Road, which lies just northeast from Singapores main Financial District and is easily reachable from both Little India and Farrar Park MRT Stations. Our guide to Little India presents all the best hotels at the lowest rates, as well as all the top places to visit, shop – and of course – where to eat!
