Singapore Flyer


If the observation deck at the Marina Bay Sands doesnt quite do it for you, try taking in high tea while looking out over the city from the Singapore Flyer, the worlds largest giant observation wheel. Choose from several different packages that allow you to be served and pampered while enjoying a view that encompasses not only the Singapore skyline, but reaches to the Spice Islands of Indonesia and Malaysias Straits of Johor. There are several different ticket packages to choose from, and each includes access to the multimedia Journey of Dreams exhibit that delves into Singapores history and the creation of the Singapore Flyer. Flights last 30 minutes each and run from early morning until late at night, so you can choose which view of the city you want to enjoy the beginning of another bustling day or when Singapore is aglow after dark.
