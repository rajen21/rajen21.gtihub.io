Fort Canning Park

As military strongholds go, Fort Canning has had a long and varied life. Built in 1859, the fort was an essential site for Singapores defense. Now in peacetime, the original building is home to modern performing arts troupes, and the park regularly sees picnics, concerts, theater performances, and festivals. Other attractions at the park include relics from Singapores early history, from as far back as the 14th century, and Sir Stamford Raffles personal bungalow. Guests can also see a replica of the spice market Raffles established in 1822, as well as the ASEAN sculptures that were erected in the 1980s.
