If youve ever visited China, Singapores Chinatown neighborhood will bring you right back there. From the small mom-and-pop stores and authentic Chinese food to the bright red lanterns, theres an excitement and hustle in this district. You can visit the Chinese Heritage Centre and see the impressive and beautiful Sri Mariamman Hindu temple. Another temple worth seeing is the Buddha Tooth Relic temple. If youre up early enough (think 4 am), you can hear the morning drum ceremony. Or you can just check out the closing ceremony in the evening after viewing the relic.

Heritage markers have been installed throughout the neighborhood in English, Japanese, and simplified Chinese so visitors can better understand the significance of the area. But this neighborhood is not just a testament to the influence of the Chinese throughout Singapores past. This is a progressive neighborhood (with free Wi-Fi for all) and its home to the trendy Ann Siang Hill area, where the quaint bistros and upscale boutiques could be at home in any Western city.
