Universal Studios Singapore


Universal Studios Singapore was the latest addition to Singapores attractions list. Opened in 2010, Universal Studios Singapore has seven themed sections with countless rides and shows, all related to major hit movies. The park is part of the US$4.5 billion Resorts World Sentosa Development. Start off in Hollywood. Strolling down Hollywood Boulevard will make you think that youre in the States, not in a tropical Asian country. This is the main shopping area of the park. New York is based of course on the city of New York and here you can have your photo snapped with movie stars such as Charlie Chaplin and Marilyn Monroe. Continue on to Sci-Fi city featuring a pair of the worlds tallest intertwining roller coasters among other things and then to Ancient Egypt where you will be faced with two massive guard statues. The atmosphere is truly that of ancient Egypt so get in to experience the Revenge of the Mummy ride, a must for adults but not quite the best thing for young kids.
